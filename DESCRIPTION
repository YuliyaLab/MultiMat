Description: MultiMat is a statistical method to perform model-based peptide-level 
             differential expression analysis of multiple datasets. MultiMat produces 
             a single fold change and p-value for each protein across multiple datasets. 
             Model-based peptide-level differential expression analysis component of 
             MultiMat package can also be used on a single dataset and will follow the 
             analysis described in  “A statistical framework for protein quantitation 
             in bottom-up MS-based proteomics” (Karpievitch et al. 2009).
